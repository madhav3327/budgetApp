How It Works

Step 1: Entrance Code

Users must enter a valid entrance code (1926) to proceed.

Step 2: Login or Register
	â€¢	Existing users log in using name and PIN.
	â€¢	New users register with name, PIN, and confirmation. Data is saved to users.csv.

Step 3: Add Expenses

Once logged in:
	â€¢	A form is shown to add product, quantity, price, and location.
	â€¢	Location is auto-filled based on the userâ€™s last entry.
	â€¢	All entries are saved to expenses.csv with user name and timestamp.

Step 4: View History

Below the form, users can see their past entries with full details.
